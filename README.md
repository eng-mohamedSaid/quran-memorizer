# 🕋 Sahib Al-Quran - Quran Memorization Website

"The Quran is a garden in the heart of its memorizer"

## 📖 Overview
Sahib Al-Quran (Companion of the Quran) is an innovative website for memorizing and reviewing the Holy Quran through listening, specifically designed for busy individuals who want to memorize the Quran while working or during their short free time.

## 🎯 Main Objective
Solving the problem of losing focus while memorizing through listening, by automatically varying the voices of reciters to ensure continued concentration and stable memorization.

## 🌟 Current Features
- **Multi-Reciter Audio**: Plays verses with multiple voices to refresh concentration
- **Smart Repetition System**: Each verse repeats with different voices to reinforce memorization
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple selection of surahs, verses, and reciters
- **Work-Compatible**: Runs in background without distraction
- **Completely Free**: No fees or subscriptions required

## 🎧 How It Works?
1. Choose the text to memorize (half page or specific verses)
2. Select your favorite reciter voices
3. Play the recitation and let it work in background
4. Focus on verses as much as possible while working
5. Review at end of day and find you've memorized most content

## 🚀 Development Story
This website was developed to solve a personal problem I faced while trying to memorize the Quran:

### 💡 The Original Problem
- I was trying to memorize using regular mobile apps
- After half an hour, I'd lose focus and get used to the reciter's voice
- Had to manually change the sheikh's voice each time

### ⚡ AI-Powered Development
I used Vibe Coding techniques with several platforms:
- **Lovable**: Good design but poor code performance
- **Firebase**: Best in terms of performance and functionality
- **Other platforms**: Similar designs with limited capabilities

So now:
- **Platform**: Firebase (basic version) it write 90% of this code and i was solving the errors that it can't solve.
- **Design**: Created using Firebase AI Tools
- **Hosting**: Vercel
- **Libraries**: Multiple (needs review and optimization)

## ⚠️ Important Technical Notes
- Code needs optimization: Using many unnecessary libraries
- Performance needs improvement: Reduce library size and improve efficiency
- Files need review: Code restructuring and organization required

## 📈 Future Development Roadmap
### 🎯 Requested Features (Based on User Requests)
#### 📢 Expanding Audio Database
1. Add new reciter voices like Elmenshawy, Elbanna and others.
2. Support different recitation styles (Hafs, Warsh, Qalun, etc.)
3. Categorize reciters by style (Tajweed, Tarteel, Haddr)

#### 📜 Text Display Enhancement
1. Uthmani Script Display: Show verses in original Uthmani calligraphy
2. Improve Quranic text font
3. Add verse and hizb numbering
4. Support translation display (optional)
